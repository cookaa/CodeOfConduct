[![Actions Status](https://github.com/allegheny-computer-science-203-s2021/lab01-CodeOfConduct/workflows/linting/badge.svg)](https://github.com/allegheny-computer-science-203-s2021/lab01-CodeOfConduct/actions)

## Summary

This repository contains the conduct guide in [Computer Science 203 Spring
2021](https://cs.allegheny.edu/sites/jjumadinova/teaching/203). The instructor
and students will use this conduct guide to govern all course interactions.

## Improving the Conduct Guide

During the Spring 2021 semester, you will work in an entire-class team to
design, implement, test, document, deploy, and use two large-scale software
applications. During each week of the semester, you will work with your team on
tasks for one of these projects. As you complete all of the laboratory and
practical assignments for this course, you are also responsible for adhering to
a team-defined code of conduct.

For this laboratory assignment, please use the [GitHub flow
model](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flow/) to collaboratively complete
the conduct guide given the instructor's template. Along with working on the code of conduct, make sure that you
enhance the list of group-related professional and technical skills on the
assessment sheet. Then, you should describe the student and instructor behaviors
that the team deems to be acceptable and unacceptable. Students are invited to
review the [Codes of Values from MIT's Course on Product Engineering
Processes](http://web.mit.edu/2.009/www/codeOfEthics/codeOfEthics.html).

Make sure that you explain how the team will handle infractions of the conduct
guide. Finally, once you are finished with this conduct guide, please update the
README as necessary. As you are collaboratively enhancing both the code of
conduct and the assessment guide, you must ensure that these two documents align
with each other.

## Problems with the Conduct Guide

If you have any problems with this conduct guide, then please create an issue
in this repository using the "Issues" link at the top of this site.
